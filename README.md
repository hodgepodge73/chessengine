# chessengine

This project will be as much of a chess engine / player that I can make.

# Steps to Develop
1. Get pieces coded
2. **Get board coded**
3. Create game manager as the main link between pieces and game board
4. Create game display to show the game
5. Test lots
6. Create game referee for additional rules
7. Decide on how we are going to actually make the brains (neural net, low sum, other)
8. Make brains
9. Adjust game to have a gui interface using the sprites I made 2 years ago (**Could be step 5 or 7**)
